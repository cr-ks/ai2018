### Directory Structure:

Group Project Link: https://github.com/jzhuo/genetic-sgd

**Update: I've added a new directory containing clojure examples.**

/sicp: an implementation of exercises from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs as functions.

``` 
cd sicp
lein run
```
Open: `src > sicp > core.clj` to see functions that have been implemented (more to come).

/updates - contains all weekly progress reports, titled by date ex. 09132018.txt (Spetember 13, 2018)

/nn - followed a neural net tutorial video on youtube and implemented in js. Also tried to convert to python as practice...

/sicp - contains clojure exercises from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. 
<br />â€¢ I need to add exercise and page numbers, and finish a few more.
