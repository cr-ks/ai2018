### CLUSTER MEETING REPORT:

In my cluster meeting we talked about what our path is that brought us to the course,
and what we are looking to get out of it.
I'm looking to gain more of a perspective on AI that will help me implement algorithms in my work.
Both Andrew and I are transfer students, which we found interesting.

We also talked about AI in general and what projects we are thinking of doing.
I told everyone that I'm mostly not sure, but I have always wanted to build a poker bot.
I read an article a year ago about how in the next five or so years online poker is just going to be
bots playing each other at levels beyond human capacity.
I've really wanted to try and mae one since then, but never had the time or correct skill sets.

### GENERAL UPDATES:

I don't have any general updates thus far.
I'm hoping today's class will inform me a little more about what I'll be working on
and I can start uploading code.

Cheers,
David
