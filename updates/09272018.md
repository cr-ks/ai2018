###CLUSTER MEETING REPORT:

My cluster meeting went okay this week. I met with Per and Jona. I'm noticing that we are running out of things to talk about because we haven't started our projects yet! We mostly discussed similiar things that were discussed in previous meetins - why we decided to take this class, what we are looking to get out of it etc. Per spoke most of the time, talking a lot about how he works in his game design groups and why he thinks he would be good at leading his eventual ai group. Jona didn't say much about that topic. Though it was quite obvious that Jona has some extensive background with Clojure and programming in general, which I respected. 

###GENERAL UPDATES:

Most of my updates for this week have to do with researching the poker bot idea further and continuing my path of learning Clojure. 

I am now "in the thick of it" in the clojure book and having a difficult time grasping some of the topics. That being said the section on functional programming as a whole made my mouth water. The whole premise is *definietly* something I could get on board with. In any case, I'm hopping to get a good handle on the language so I can at least use it a little in this class. Untill next time... 

Cheers,
David
