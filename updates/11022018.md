###CLUSTER MEETING REPORT:

My cluster meeting this week was very lowkey. Each of us just talked about what we have been working on in our groups and compared how far each was getting. Jona and Per are working together so they spoke to that. I spoke mostly about how my group has switched our focus but are making decent progress regardless. 

Side note : I will be meeting with Jack this week to catch me up to speed on everything I missed from one of our group meetings.

###GENERAL UPDATES:

Most of my general updates are about clojure. I did a lot of research over the past two weeks on the history of LISP. I found an article about the book: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, which I'm sure you know of. I also read over Mccarthy's original paper on LISP here: https://aiplaybook.a16z.com/reference-material/mccarthy-1960.pdf

Thanks!
