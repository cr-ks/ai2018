### PROJECT UPDATES:

You can find our project github link here: <https://github.com/jzhuo/genetic-sgd>. Most of the work that I've contributed to the project as a whole has been during our group coding sessions. You can see my personal updates by checking the commits page (my user name is cr-ks). I also worked one-on-one with Jack a couple of weeks ago to help fill in some gaps I had with Python semantics.

### GENERAL UPDATES:

In general, I've still been working on learning clojure. I finished reading Clojure for the Brave and True and have now moved on to Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman. I'm hoping to finish it by the end of December. What I'd like to get out of this book is a deeper understanding of LISPs in general. I think I'd also like to implement a simple GA in clojure soon in order to test my understanding.

Thanks!
David
