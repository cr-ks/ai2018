### FINAL UPDATE:

In conclusion, I've learned a ton this semester about AI algorithms and working in a group setting. My group mostly worked in mob programming which was a new experience for me. I "drove" during our last two meetings which allowed me to gain perspective on how the others would program each piece, while also letting me have some control over the process. I also dug into clojure this semester. I still have a decent way to go ( and with functional programming in general ). I've included some examples of my clojure stuff, A modified neural net in javascript and python, and my group work.  You can see all of the group work here: <https://github.com/jzhuo/genetic-sgd>.
