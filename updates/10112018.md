### CLUSTER MEETING REPORT:

My cluster this week was with the team I will be working on the project with. I met with them briefly after class both last week and this week. I was unable to meet the group on Monday because my computer had stopped working. In the meeting today they got me up to speed and we will be moving foward with our research based on Uber.

### GENERAL UPDATES:

I'm about halfway through the Clojure book! I'm really liking learning clojure and definielty see myself working with it in the future. I've been using learning clojure as my main project for this course before we start on group projects. Now that we've chosen the group and decided on projects (ours will be written in Python), I will be focusing much more on contributions to that project. I do still hope to finish the textbook and use clojure for a personal project soon.

Thanks!
David
